# Linck-book-chapter_MEMs-for-ind-diffs
This repository contains the R code and sample data file discussed in the book chapter, "Analyzing individual differences in second language research with mixed effects models" to be included in the forthcoming volume, "Cognitive Individual Differences in L2 Processing and Acquisition" (John Benjamins), edited by Daniel Jackson, Gisela Granena, and Yucel Yilmaz.

I owe thanks to Scott Jackson and Noah Silbert for the many productive discussions about mixed effects modeling, and Daniel Jackson for comments on a previous draft of the chapter and R code.
