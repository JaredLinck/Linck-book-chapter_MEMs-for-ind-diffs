# Linck-book-chapter_MEMs-for-ind-diffs
This repository contains the R code and sample data file discussed in the book chapter, "Analyzing individual differences in second language research with mixed effects models" to be included in the forthcoming volume, "Cognitive Individual Differences in L2 Processing and Acquisition" (John Benjamins), edited by Daniel Jackson, Gisela Granena, and Yucel Yilmaz.

There are two files included here:
  (1) "Linck - sample dataset.txt" contains the raw data that can be analyzed to follow along with the book chapter.
  (2) "Linck sample R code.R" includes the R code described in the book chapter. It assumes you already have installed the R software and the 'lme4' package within R, and that the data file is located in the same location as the code.

I owe thanks to Scott Jackson and Noah Silbert for the many productive discussions about mixed effects modeling, and Daniel Jackson and anonymous reviewers for comments on a previous draft of the chapter and R code.
